## Installation

Download and unzip the contents of this repository into your plugins folder. If you don't know where your plugins folder is, [follow these steps](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/support/developer/01-introduction/01.html) to find it.

## Usage

1. In Sketch, select the layers that you want to replace with Instagram photos, then run the plugin.  
	* _Note: First time you use the plugin, you'll be asked to login to Instagram. The plugin will remember you until you log out._

2. Once you're logged in, select the source of the photos you want to use.

3. You can choose to either replace selected layers with new Bitmap layers, or insert photos as pattern fills (useful for adding images to round shapes).  
4. If you're using Sketch at work, you might want to log out of Instagram when you're done.

### Image sizes

Instagram makes photos available in three sizes.  

SketchSquares Plugin will guess the image size you want to load based on the size of the layers you've selected. You can change this using the size menu.

### Shortcut

Once you've installed the plugin you can trigger it using this shortcut: `control` + `shift` + `i`. You can change this shortcut (if it clashes with other plugins you may be using) by editing the first line of the `Load Instagram Photos.sketchplugin` file.

### Updates

The SketchSquares Plugin will automatically check for updates when you run it, and will let you know when a new version is available for download. It will let you install the updated version directly from the plugin window.

## Inspiration and Credits

The inspiration for the SketchSquares Plugin came from a post by [@iansilber](https://twitter.com/iansilber) called [Design Tools at Instagram](https://medium.com/@iansilber/design-tools-at-instagram-4f5867afa4f4).

Making this plugin was possible only through all the tricks I've learned from the awesome [Sketch](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) community. Thanks everyone!
